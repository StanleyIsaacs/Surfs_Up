# Project: Surfs_Up
## Overview of Analysis: 
### We have been tasked with analyzing temperature trends on the Island of Oahu for June and December to determine if W. Avy should open up a year round Surf and ice cream shop or if the weather would make that too risky a business venture. We used Python, Jupyter, VS Code and Flask.

## Results
### How things shook out in June and December: See thumbnails below for a full picture of the temperature details for the two months

* The average temps for June and December were 75 and 71 degrees
* The lowest temps were 64 and 56 degrees
* The higest temps were 85 and 83 degrees

## Summary
### We should go for it!
#### The weather temperature wise is pretty consistent for both months leading me to believe a Surf and Ice Cream shop could exist year round in Oahu. Because the average temps are only four degrees apart and we looked at two very different months during the calendar, there isn't a big enough swing that should concern us. If we look at outliers (lowest and highest temps), there doesn't seem to be a big enough swing to scare us. It's Hawaii so it never gets too cold for ice cream and even the hottest months don't have highs that would scare tourists off. As far as other queries we could run, I have a couple to suggest for further information. We should certainly do one for precipitation. There could be a rainy season and massive rain coiuld dissuade people from surfing or getting ice cream. We could do a second querie to get results from the most active station to see if that changes any of our results as well.
